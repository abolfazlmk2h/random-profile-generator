# Random Profile Generator

Hi!:wave: This is my first project in Github! I'm learning Javascript and I developed this project during my learning process. In this project you can generate random profiles with custom fields directly in your browser.

## Install

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```
after installing packages, use

```bash
$ npm start
```

to run parcel and parcel will bundle the project for you. Visit `http://localhost:1234` in your browser to see bundled project.
